Title : TicTacToe - Game
Abstract :
Game Overview
 Objective: Players take turns marking a space in a 3x3 grid. The first to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
Players: Typically two players, one using "X" and the other "O".
Game Mechanics
 Grid Representation: A 3x3 grid can be represented using a 2D array or a list of lists in programming. Each cell can hold a value representing empty, "X", or "O".
Turn Management: Players alternate turns. You can implement this by maintaining a variable that tracks whose turn it is.
Win Conditions: After each move, check for win conditions:
Three in a row horizontally: Check each row.
Three in a row vertically: Check each column.
Three in a row diagonally: Check the two diagonals.
Draw Condition: If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
